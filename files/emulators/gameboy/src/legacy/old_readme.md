## Functionality
So far here's what Pollen Boy has:
- Load ROMs
- Custom Palletes
- Sound ! (PHAT WIP)
- Gameboy DMG CPU
- PPU and Display
- Joypad
- CPU Interrupts

## How To Use
Open the webpage, click <kbd>Choose ROM</kbd> and enjoy !
The default controls are:
```
D-Pad: Arrow Keys
B: X
A: Z
Start: Enter
Select: Right Shift
```

On the right of the page are some settings, including:
### Save Files
If a game has save support, you can click <kbd>Export</kbd> to download the save on your drive.

You can then <kbd>Import</kbd> save files onto games to continue your progress !

### Color palletes
If you wanna change the look of the game, you can choose from a list of color palletes i included.
(I might add the ability to import custom palletes who knows)

This doesn't actually affect the game, it just changes the default 4 shades the GB has uwu

(PS: Pollen Boy does NOT come with roms ! You have to uhh ummm ,,, dump them urself ! ya dump them)
